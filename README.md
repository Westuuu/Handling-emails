## Important
## Interface is not ready yet, to run answers to tasks, please use commands at the bottom of the script

As of now script lacks a few things but other than that functions are ready to use.\
Things to add:\
**-task number 1 needs changing the output to desired one**\
-commands to call functions\
-simple interface\
-lack of handling exceptions(I believe, mostly in commands)\
-readme with examples of how to use the script\
-needs improvement with path to files - I'd like to change it to relative path\
-function for task number 4 needs to be changed to receive file_path provided by user\
-Add `argparse` interface\
-move files to make the folders more readable
